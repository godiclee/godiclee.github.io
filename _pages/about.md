Experience
======
* **Taiwan AI Labs**  
    *Machine Learning Enigneer | Aug. 2021 - Nov. 2024*
    * **Speech AI Enhancements:**
        * **Speaker:** Led the development of state-of-the-art speaker diarization for [Yating Transcriber](https://studio.yating.tw/intro/zh-TW/transkribera), outperforming two key competitors in real-world applications and achieving top results on academic benchmarks. See my [master's thesis](#publications) for more details.
        * **ASR:** Reduced Word Error Rate (WER) by 20% in specialized Automatic Speech Recognition models using self-
          supervised learning, providing transcription services to financial and medical sectors.
        * **TTS & VC:** Enabled rapid deployment of multilingual Text-to-Speech and Voice Cloning models for video translation and
          public broadcasting with minimal data (5 minutes) or zero-shot capabilities, enhancing content accessibility and reach.
        * **Products:** [Yating Studio](https://studio.yating.tw/intro/zh-TW)
    * **Advanced NLP & LLM Applications:**
        * **RAG:** Improved customer service chatbot user experience by engineering a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline
          that enhanced retrieval accuracy by 25%, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and speed.
        * **Multimodal LLMs:** Architected a novel pipeline leveraging Multimodal LLMs, RAG, and custom modules for efficient summarization and retrieval from long-form video content (1hr+).
        * **Products:** [Federated GPT](https://fedgpt.cc/)
* **Teaching Assistant at NTU**  
    *Machine Learning (Fall 2021), Prof. Hung-yi Lee | Mar. 2021 - Jul. 2021*
    * Designed two assignments on BERT and Explainable AI for a class of over 1,000 students.
